 * @var competitionData

 * the data contained in the Competitions table about the competition.  Use of this class
 * depends on functionality in the _database.php include file - a connection is expected.
 *
 * Available methods:
 *  - get($val): returns a data value from the competition.  Returns a boolean FALSE upon
 *    failure - use "identical" comparison operators to check for failed returns.
 *  - load($competitionId): (re-)load another competition.

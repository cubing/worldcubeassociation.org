Description:
  This file contains public information on all official WCA competitions,
  WCA members and WCA competition results.

Goal:
  Goal of this file is for members of our community to do analysis on the
  information for statistical and personal purposes.

Allowed use: Information and parts of it may be published online,
but only under the following conditions:
  - A clearly visible link to World Cube Association website is added
    (https://www.worldcubeassociation.org) with the notification that
    World Cube Association is the source and owner of the information.
  - A clearly visible notification is added that the published information
    is not actual information.
  - A clearly visible link to https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results is
    added with the notification that the actual information can be found via
    that link.
  - A clearly visible notification which date is taken for the source of the data.
  - The style and format of the information must be clearly distinguishable
    from the official WCA website

  eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship    See explanation below

Most of the tables should be self-explanatory, but several things merit further
explanation.

Countries stores include those from the Wikipedia list of countries at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries, and may include some countries
that no longer exist.  The ISO2 column should reflect ISO 3166-1 alpha-2
country codes, for countries that have them.  Custom codes may used in some
circumstances.

eligible_country_iso2s_for_championship stores information about which citizenships are eligible
to win special cross-country championship types. For example, "greater_china" is a special
championship type which contains 4 iso2: CN, HK, MC and TW. This means competitors from China,
Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan are eligible to win a competition with championship type "greater_china".

Scrambles stores all scrambles. For 333mbf, an attempt is comprised of multiple, newline separated
scrambles. Unfortunately, newlines don't work so well in TSV, so we use "|" as a scramble delimiter
instead.

Result values of the Results table can be interpreted as follows:
- The result values are in fields value1-value5, best and average.
- Value -1 means DNF
- Value -2 means DNS
- Value 0 means "nothing", for example a best-of-3 has value4=value5=average=0
- Positive values depend on the event, see column "format" in Events.
  - Most events have format "time", where the value represents centiseconds.
    For example, 8653 means 1 minute and 26.53 seconds.
  - Format "number" means the value is a raw number, currently only used
    by "fewest moves" for number of moves.
    - Fewest moves averages are stored as 100 times the average, rounded.
  - Format "multi" is for old and new multi-blind, encoding not only the time
    but also the number of attempted and solved cubes. Writing the value in
    decimal it is interpreted ("decoded") using the following method:
      old: 1SSAATTTTT
             solved        = 99 - SS
             attempted     = AA
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
      new: 0DDTTTTTMM
             difference    = 99 - DD
             timeInSeconds = TTTTT (99999 means unknown)
             missed        = MM
             solved        = difference + missed
             attempted     = solved + missed
    In order to encode data, the following procedure should be followed:
             solved    = # cubes solved
             attempted = # cubes attempted
             missed    = # cubes missed = attempted - solved
             DD        = 99 - (solved - missed)
             TTTTT     = solve time in seconds
             MM        = missed
    Note that this is designed so that a smaller value means a better result.
    This format does not allow for more than 99 attempted cubes, or for times
    greater than 99999 seconds (about 27.7 hours).

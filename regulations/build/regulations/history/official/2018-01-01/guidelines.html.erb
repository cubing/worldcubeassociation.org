<li id="4b2+"><a href="#4b2+">4b2+</a>) <span class="CLARIFICATION label linked"><a href="./#4b2">CLARIFICATION</a></span> In general, all official scramble sequences should be kept secret during the competition and published together after the end of the competition (see <a href="./#1c3a">Regulation 1c3a</a>).

<li id="4d++"><a href="#4d++">4d++</a>) <span class="ADDITION label linked"><a href="./#4d">ADDITION</a></span> It is permitted for the puzzle to change its orientation when it is moved from the scrambler to the solving station, as long as no one is attempting to influence the randomness of the orientation (see <a href="./#A2e1">Regulation A2e1</a>).</li>
<li id="4f+"><a href="#4f+">4f+</a>) <span class="RECOMMENDATION label linked"><a href="./#4f">RECOMMENDATION</a></span> The WCA Delegate should generate sufficient scramble sequences for the entire competition ahead of time, including spare scramble sequences for extra attempts.</li>

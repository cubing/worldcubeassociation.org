      <%= add_answer "How do I obtain a WCA ID and a WCA profile?" do %>
        If you have never competed before, go to a <a href="/results/competitions.php">competition</a>!
        A WCA ID and WCA profile will be created for you when the results from your first
        competition are uploaded.
      <% end %>

      <%= add_answer "How can I find a WCA competition?" do %>
        Check out our list of <%= link_to "competitions", "/results/competitions.php" %>!
      <% end %>

      <%= add_answer "How can I register for a competition? Who can I refer to if I have problems registering for a competition?" do %>
        Many competitions do registration right here on the WCA website, but some use their
        own systems. You should contact the organizers of the competition you want
        to compete in for more details.

        <div>
          Search for a competition here:
          <input id="competitions_search" class="wca-autocomplete wca-autocomplete-only_one wca-autocomplete-competitions_search"></input>
          <script>
            (function() {
              $('#competitions_search').wcaAutocomplete();
              $('#competitions_search')[0].selectize.on('change', function(competitionId) {
                location.href = "/competitions/" + competitionId;
              });
            })();
          </script>
        </div>

      <%= add_answer "What are the requirements for attending a WCA competition? What do I need to know before attending a WCA competition?" do %>
        In general, there are not many requirements for a person to participate
        at a WCA competition. However, all participants of a competition are expected
        to have a good understanding of the
        <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/">WCA regulations</a>.
        In addition, we would recommend having a look at
        <%= link_to "Cubing USA's competitor tutorial", "http://www.cubingusa.com/ctutorial.php", target: "_blank" %>, which gives several nice hints for newcomers.
      <% end %>

      <%= add_answer "What are the WCA accounts for? What is the difference between WCA accounts and WCA profiles?" do %>
        <p>
          You are assigned a WCA ID when you first participate in a WCA
          sanctioned competition. When the results from that competition are uploaded,
          your WCA profile will be created, with results from every competition you have
          been to.
        </p>

        <p>
          WCA accounts allow you to prove to us who you are. This allows you
          to add a picture to your WCA profile, and allows you
          to register for competitions. This will protect you from
          other people pretending to be you.
        </p>

        <p>
          <% if current_user %>
            You are already logged in with a WCA account.
          <% else %>
            You can create an account <%= link_to "here", new_user_registration_path %>.
          <% end %>
        </p>
      <% end %>

      <%= add_answer "How do I change my profile picture?" do %>
        <p>
          First, you need to
          <a href="#how-do-i-connect-my-wca-account-with-my-wca-id">
            create a WCA account and connect it to your WCA ID.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          After you have connected your WCA account and your WCA ID, go to your
          <%= link_to "edit profile page", profile_edit_path %> to change your
          profile picture.
        </p>
      <% end %>

      <%= add_answer "How do I connect my WCA account with my WCA ID?" do %>
        <% if current_user %>
          You can claim your WCA ID <%= link_to "here", profile_claim_wca_id_path %>.
        <% else %>
          Create an account <%= link_to "here", new_user_registration_path %>. After you log in with
          your new account, you will be asked to claim your WCA ID.

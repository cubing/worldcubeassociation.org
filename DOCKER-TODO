## Notes
- I was able to tweak the mysql:latest image? we ran "docker rmi -f mysql" to nuke it, but then we had to redownload it from the internet when running "docker-compose up" next.
- mysql max_packet_size? http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/19135/mysql-error-reading-communication-packets
  - looks like 4194304 bytes is good enough now? (show variables like '%max_allowed_packet%';)
